Focus Mate is a productivity web application designed to help people with ADHD  stay focused and organized by allowing them to manage tasks effectively. With a visually engaging design and interactive features, Focus Mate serves as a simple yet powerful tool to enhance your productivity and improve your concentration.

##**Why this idea?**

we came to this idea after a lot of contemplation about simple other projects.Initially we were not having any ideas. But then one of our friends happen to call 
us. He has ADHD,and it suddenly striked us that why not focus on such an idea.More often than not people with ADHD or other mental illness struggle with not being able to talk about their issues with focusing and productivity. So we wanted to do something that can even be remotely of help to them.
